/**
 * This class extends <code>Socket</code>s and provides secure
 * socket using protocols such as the "Secure
 * Sockets Layer" (SSL) or IETF "Transport Layer Security" (TLS) protocols.
 * <P>
 * Such sockets are normal stream sockets, but they
 * add a layer of security protections over the underlying network transport
 * protocol, such as TCP.  Those protections include: <UL>
 *
 *      <LI> <em>Integrity Protection</em>.  SSL protects against
 *      modification of messages by an active wiretapper.
 *
 *      <LI> <em>Authentication</em>.  In most modes, SSL provides
 *      peer authentication.  Servers are usually authenticated,
 *      and clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.
 *
 *      <LI> <em>Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)</em>.  In most
 *      modes, SSL encrypts data being sent between client and server.
 *      This protects the confidentiality of data, so that passive
 *      wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
 *      information or personal information of many kinds.
 *
 *      </UL>
 *
 * <P>These kinds of protection are specified by a "cipher suite", which
 * is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL connection.
 * During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must agree on
 * a ciphersuite that is available in both environments.
 * If there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can
 * be established, and no data can be exchanged.
 *
 * <P> The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process
 * called "handshaking".  The goal of this
 * process is to create or rejoin a "session", which may protect many
 * connections over time.  After handshaking has completed, you can access
 * session attributes by using the <em>getSession</em> method.
 * The initial handshake on this connection can be initiated in
 * one of three ways: <UL>
 *
 *      <LI> calling <code>startHandshake</code> which explicitly
 *              begins handshakes, or
 *      <LI> any attempt to read or write application data on
 *              this socket causes an implicit handshake, or
 *      <LI> a call to <code>getSession</code> tries to set up a session
 *              if there is no currently valid session, and
 *              an implicit handshake is done.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P>If handshaking fails for any reason, the <code>SSLSocket</code>
 * is closed, and no further communications can be done.
 *
 * <P>There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
 * about when managing cipher suites: <UL>
 *
 *      <LI> <em>Supported</em> cipher suites:  all the suites which are
 *      supported by the SSL implementation.  This list is reported
 *      using <em>getSupportedCipherSuites</em>.
 *
 *      <LI> <em>Enabled</em> cipher suites, which may be fewer
 *      than the full set of supported suites.  This group is
 *      set using the <em>setEnabledCipherSuites</em> method, and
 *      queried using the <em>getEnabledCipherSuites</em> method.
 *      Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on
 *      a new socket that represents the minimum suggested configuration.
 *
 *      </UL>
 *
 * <P> Implementation defaults require that only cipher
 * suites which authenticate servers and provide confidentiality
 * be enabled by default.
 * Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated and/or
 * non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a ciphersuite be
 * selected.
 *
 * <P>When <code>SSLSocket</code>s are first created, no handshaking
 * is done so that applications may first set their communication
 * preferences:  what cipher suites to use, whether the socket should be
 * in client or server mode, etc.
 * However, security is always provided by the time that application data
 * is sent over the connection.
 *
 * <P> You may register to receive event notification of handshake
 * completion.  This involves
 * the use of two additional classes.  <em>HandshakeCompletedEvent</em>
 * objects are passed to <em>HandshakeCompletedListener</em> instances,
 * which are registered by users of this API.
 *
 * <code>SSLSocket</code>s are created by <code>SSLSocketFactory</code>s,
 * or by <code>accept</code>ing a connection from a
 * <code>SSLServerSocket</code>.
 *
 * <P>A SSL socket must choose to operate in the client or server mode.
 * This will determine who begins the handshaking process, as well
 * as which messages should be sent by each party.  Each
 * connection must have one client and one server, or handshaking
 * will not progress properly.  Once the initial handshaking has started, a
 * socket can not switch between client and server modes, even when
 * performing renegotiations.
